# Initiative Tracker
This project is a fun attempt at making an initiative tracker for Dungeons & Dragons 5e, using a Component based UI system in a console application.

### TODOs
* Use DrawLine for DrawRectangle in Renderer
* Call Draw() on top most level component every ReadKey()
  * This should remove the need for components to call Draw() on themselves
